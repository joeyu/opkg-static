Static self-contained opkg binary for Android
=============================================

These are build scripts to build a fully static, dependency-less
opkg binary for Android. Opkg is a package manager for embedded
systems, http://code.google.com/p/opkg/ ,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opkg

The idea of this project is to provide an opkg build independent
of the underlying Android system. Full independence of underlying
system means it can be used on non-rooted device, or could be used
even to manage Android installation itself ("Packaged Android").
To these ends, opkg is built statically, against libcurl (to not
depend on standalone wget), which in turn is built against c-ares,
to not rely on /etc/resolv.conf being available (you can't
create/edit that on non-rooted device).

Usage:

./download.sh
./build.sh
./install.sh

This will download sources, build them, and install on a connected
Android device.
